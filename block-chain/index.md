- Blockchain is a record-keeping and contract-enforcement technology that uses cryptography to make it extremely difficult to change previous history
- Block chain lets you implement the business process when you need to trust data and participants without using a central database
- Normally a central database ia used as a source of truth
- think of this as a supply chain for the milk where you need to figure out in which step or company is at fault
- We can't rely on the central database because of it can be modified and not all companies can have the same requirements to have and use one central database.
- What about a distributed database?
  Blockchain technology is referred to as a distributed ledger. Just like an accounting ledger, the distributed ledger is a history of transactions. Each transaction in the ledger affects the final state.

Blockchain networks that are distributed among participants are called a consortium network. The consortium network gives each partner visibility into every transaction that occurs on the network.

Each node is connected to other nodes using a blockchain network. For example, Dalia Pelayo farms, the ice cream factory, and the ice cream shops each have a node they manage.

Each node processes the transaction but it still requires validation(who's at fault) using a consensus mechanism. Consensus enables consistency and trust for the distributed ledger.

Consensus ensures the correct order of transactions and the integrity of the blockchain.

As part of **consensus**, a group of transactions is validated as a block and the network must agree if the block should be included in the blockchain.

A **block** is a cluster of data within the blockchain that stores transaction information

lodger is trustable?
Blockchain uses a cryptographic hash to create link between blocks.
blocks are chained together through hashes.
an immutable chain of transactions is created in order
If any block is modified in the chain, the hash of later blocks is different. As a result, validation discovers the discrepancy.
