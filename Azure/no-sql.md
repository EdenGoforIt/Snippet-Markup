# index

- no need to worry about normalization
- schema flexible
- Eventual consistency - updates made to distributesd no sql databases will eventually be reflected across all nodes
- distributed (sql could be hard to distributed); data is spread across multiple nodes

## Consistency

- ACID not guaranteed
- Update would not be immediate but eventually concsistent

## Indexing

## Qeuries

- no support query language, instead create procedural program

## MapReduce

- split the query up and merge the results

## Sharding

- partitioning pattern; separate servers store partitions of the database
