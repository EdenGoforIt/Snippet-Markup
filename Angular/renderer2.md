- normally used with `directive`
- assign Angular to do DOM rendering instead of directly touching the DOM

- Renderer and ElementRef are not "either this or that", but instead they have to be used together to get full platform abstraction.
- Renderer acts on the DOM and ElementRef is a reference to an element in the DOM the Renderer acts on.
- The Renderer is a class that is a partial abstraction over the DOM. Using the Renderer for manipulating the DOM doesn't break server-side rendering or Web Workers (where direct access to the DOM would break).
- So when direct access to native elements is not supported you should use renderer
- Renderer is not direct DOM manipulation â€” as long as you're going through the Angular APIs,
- tapping into the nativeElement of an ElementRef can cause headaches if you ever need to do server-side rendering.
- The nativeElement Property contains the reference to the underlying DOM object. This gives us direct access to the DOM, bypassing the Angular.
