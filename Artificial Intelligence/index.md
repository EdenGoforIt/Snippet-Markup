### Graph

Directed graphs (one way)

undirected graph (two ways)
loops allowed and node can have multiple parents

## MinHeap

A MinHeap is a binary heap where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent. The smallest value is always at the root of the tree.

## MaxHeap

A MaxHeap is a binary heap where the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent. The largest value is always at the root of the tree.
