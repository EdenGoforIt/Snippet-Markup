# Release Branch Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the release branch strategy adopted by our team. This strategy aims to ensure a stable and predictable release process, allowing for ongoing development while preparing for new releases and addressing critical issues in released versions. We will be adhering to **Semantic Versioning** for our releases and may utilize **alpha** and **beta** stages for early releases.

## Strategy Name: Feature Branch Workflow with Release Branches

This strategy builds upon the foundation of a feature branch workflow and introduces dedicated release branches to stabilize code before deployment.

## Core Principles

- **`main` Branch Stability:** The `main` branch will always reflect the currently deployed, production-ready code.
- **Isolated Release Preparation:** Release preparation activities (bug fixes, documentation updates, final testing) will be isolated to dedicated release branches.
- **Continuous Development:** Active development of new features will continue on the `develop` branch and feature branches while a release is being prepared.
- **Clear Release History:** The branching strategy will provide a clear and traceable history of all releases.
- **Semantic Versioning:** All releases will follow the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specification (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## Branching Model

We will utilize the following long-lived branches:

- **`main`:** The primary branch where the code of the current production release resides. Only release branches are merged into `main`.
- **`develop`:** The integration branch for all new features. Developers create feature branches off `develop` and merge them back into `develop`.
- **`release-*`:** Temporary branches created from `develop` when a new release cycle begins. These branches are used for final stabilization and preparation of a specific release. The naming convention should be `release-X.Y.Z` (e.g., `release-1.0.0`, `release-1.1.0`).

## Release Workflow

The following steps outline the process for preparing and releasing a new version:

1.  **Initiate Release Branch:** When the `develop` branch has accumulated enough features for a new release (e.g., aiming for version `X.Y.Z`), a new branch named `release-X.Y.Z` is created from the `develop` branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b release-X.Y.Z
    git push origin release-X.Y.Z
    ```

    - The version number `X.Y.Z` should follow Semantic Versioning principles:
      - **MAJOR (X):** Incremented for incompatible API changes.
      - **MINOR (Y):** Incremented for adding functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
      - **PATCH (Z):** Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

2.  **Release Preparation:** The `release-X.Y.Z` branch is dedicated to final release preparation tasks:

    - **Bug Fixing:** Only critical bug fixes related to the upcoming release should be applied to this branch. Avoid introducing new features. These fixes should typically result in an increment of the `PATCH` version.
    - **Documentation Updates:** Update release notes, user manuals, and any other relevant documentation.
    - **Final Testing:** Perform thorough testing on this branch to ensure stability.
    - **Version Updates:** Update version numbers in the codebase (e.g., in configuration files, `package.json`, etc.). Ensure these reflect the final release version.
    - **Communicate Changes:** Ensure the team is aware of the ongoing release preparation and any changes being made to the release branch.

3.  **Alpha and Beta Releases (Optional):** For significant new features or changes, we may opt for alpha or beta releases from the `release-*` branch:

    - **Alpha Releases:** Early pre-releases, often feature-incomplete and potentially unstable, used for initial feedback. Tagged with a pre-release identifier like `X.Y.Z-alpha.N`.
    - **Beta Releases:** More stable pre-releases with most features implemented, used for wider testing. Tagged with a pre-release identifier like `X.Y.Z-beta.N`.
    - To create an alpha or beta release, you would merge the `release-*` branch into `main` with the appropriate tag:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z
      git tag -a X.Y.Z-alpha.1 -m "Alpha release version X.Y.Z-alpha.1"
      git push origin main --tags
      ```

4.  **Final Release (Merge into `main`):** Once the `release-X.Y.Z` branch is stable and ready for the final release (potentially after one or more alpha/beta releases), it is merged into the `main` branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z
    git tag -a X.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```

    - `--no-ff`: This option ensures that a merge commit is always created, providing a clear record of the release merge in the `main` branch history.
    - `git tag`: A tag with the final release version number (following SemVer) is created on the `main` branch to mark the exact point of the release.

5.  **Merge into `develop`:** The changes made in the `release-X.Y.Z` branch (including bug fixes, version updates, and potentially completed features if no alpha/beta stages were used) should also be merged back into the `develop` branch to ensure that these changes are included in future development.

    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-X.Y.Z
    git push origin develop
    ```

6.  **Cleanup:** Once the release is complete and merged into both `main` and `develop`, the `release-X.Y.Z` branch can be deleted.
    ```bash
    git branch -d release-X.Y.Z
    git push origin --delete release-X.Y.Z
    ```

## Hotfix Strategy

Critical bugs found in the production release (on the `main` branch) need to be addressed with a hotfix. The process is as follows:

1.  **Create Hotfix Branch:** A new branch named `hotfix-X.Y.Z.A` (incrementing the `PATCH` version according to SemVer) is created directly from the `main` branch at the release tag.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b hotfix-X.Y.Z.A <release_tag>
    git push origin hotfix-X.Y.Z.A
    ```

    Replace `<release_tag>` with the tag of the problematic release (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

2.  **Implement Hotfix:** The necessary bug fixes are implemented and thoroughly tested on the `hotfix-X.Y.Z.A` branch.

3.  **Merge into `main`:** Once the hotfix is verified, it is merged back into the `main` branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge --no-ff hotfix-X.Y.Z.A
    git tag -a X.Y.Z.A -m "Hotfix release version X.Y.Z.A"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```

4.  **Merge into `develop`:** The hotfix changes should also be merged into the `develop` branch to ensure that the fix is included in future releases.

    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff hotfix-X.Y.Z.A
    git push origin develop
    ```

5.  **Cleanup:** The `hotfix-X.Y.Z.A` branch can then be deleted.
    ```bash
    git branch -d hotfix-X.Y.Z.A
    git push origin --delete hotfix-X.Y.Z.A
    ```

## Benefits

- **Stability of `main`:** Ensures that the `main` branch always contains production-ready code.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Isolates release preparation from ongoing feature development.
- **Organized Release Process:** Provides a structured and repeatable process for releasing software.
- **Traceable History:** Offers a clear history of releases through merge commits and tags in the `main` branch.
- **Efficient Hotfixes:** Allows for quick and targeted fixes to production issues.
- **Clear Versioning:** Adherence to Semantic Versioning provides clarity on the nature and impact of each release.
- **Early Feedback:** Utilization of alpha and beta releases allows for early feedback and identification of potential issues.

## Considerations

- **Team Communication:** Effective communication is crucial to ensure everyone understands the release process, the status of release branches, and the meaning of version numbers and pre-release identifiers.
- **Branching Discipline:** Strict adherence to the branching model is necessary for the strategy to be effective.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Be prepared to resolve merge conflicts when merging release branches into `main` and `develop`, and when merging hotfixes.
- **Automation:** Consider automating parts of the release process (e.g., tag creation, build and deployment triggers, version bumping) to improve efficiency.
- **Strict Semantic Versioning:** Ensure the team understands and follows the rules of Semantic Versioning when determining release versions.
- **Alpha/Beta Management:** Define clear criteria for when to use alpha and beta releases and how feedback will be handled during these stages.

## Conclusion

By adopting this release branch strategy, incorporating Semantic Versioning and the potential use of alpha and beta releases, we aim to streamline our release process, improve the stability of our production code, gather early feedback, and provide clear communication about the nature of each release. Consistent adherence to these guidelines will contribute to a more efficient and reliable software delivery lifecycle.
