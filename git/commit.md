# Conventional Commit Messages [![starline](https://starlines.qoo.monster/assets/gists/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)](https://github.com/qoomon/starline)

See how [a minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference.

> [!TIP]
> Have a look at **[git-conventional-commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits)** , a CLI util to ensure these conventions, determine version and generate changelogs

## Commit Message Formats

### Default

<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#description">&lt;description&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty separator line</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>

### Merge Commit

<pre>
Merge branch '<b>&lt;branch name&gt;</b>'
</pre>

<sup>Follows default git merge message</sup>

### Revert Commit

<pre>
Revert "<b>&lt;reverted commit subject line&gt;</b>"
</pre>

<sup>Follows default git revert message</sup>

### Inital Commit

```
chore: init
```

### Types

- API or UI relevant changes
      - `feat` Commits, that add or remove a new feature to the API or UI
      - `fix` Commits, that fix a API or UI bug of a preceded `feat` commit
- `refactor` Commits, that rewrite/restructure your code, however do not change any API or UI behaviour
      - `perf` Commits are special `refactor` commits, that improve performance
- `style` Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test` Commits, that add missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` Commits, that affect documentation only
- `build` Commits, that affect build components like build tool, ci pipeline, dependencies, project version, ...
- `ops` Commits, that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery, ...
- `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`

### Scopes

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Allowed Scopes depends on the specific project
- Don't use issue identifiers as scopes

### Breaking Changes Indicator

Breaking changes should be indicated by an `!` before the `:` in the subject line e.g. `feat(api)!: remove status endpoint`

- Is an **optional** part of the format

### Description

The `description` contains a concise description of the change.

- Is a **mandatory** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
    - Think of `This commit will...` or `This commit should...`
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end

### Body

The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- This is the place to mention issue identifiers and their relations

### Footer

The `footer` should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to **reference Issues** that this commit refers to.

- Is an **optional** part of the format
- **optionally** reference an issue by its id.
- **Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGES:` followed by space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Versioning

- **If** your next release contains commit with...
     - **breaking changes** incremented the **major version**
     - **API relevant changes** (`feat` or `fix`) incremented the **minor version**
- **Else** increment the **patch version**

### Examples

- ````
    feat: add email notifications on new direct messages
    ```
  ````
- ````
    feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button
    ```
  ````
- ```

## Git Hook Scripts to ensure commit message header format

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
   
### commit-msg Hook (local)
- Create a commit-msg hook using [git-conventional-commits cli](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits?tab=readme-ov-file#automatically-validate-commit-message-convention-before-commit)

### pre-receive Hook (server side)

- create following file in your repository folder `.git/hooks/pre-receive`
    ```shell
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

# Pre-receive hook that will block commits with messges that do not follow regex rule

commit_msg_type_regex='feat|fix|refactor|style|test|docs|build'
  commit_msg_scope_regex='.{1,20}'
  commit_msg_description_regex='.{1,100}'
  commit_msg_regex="^(${commit_msg_type_regex})(\(${commit_msg_scope_regex}\))?: (${commit_msg_description_regex})\$"
  merge_msg_regex="^Merge branch '.+'\$"

zero_commit="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

# Do not traverse over commits that are already in the repository
  excludeExisting="--not --all"

error=""
  while read oldrev newrev refname; do
    # branch or tag get deleted
    if [ "$newrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      continue
    fi

# Check for new branch or tag
    if [ "$oldrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      rev_span=`git rev-list $newrev $excludeExisting`
    else
      rev_span=`git rev-list $oldrev..$newrev $excludeExisting`
    fi

for commit in $rev_span; do
      commit_msg_header=$(git show -s --format=%s $commit)
      if ! [[ "$commit_msg_header" =~ (${commit_msg_regex})|(${merge_msg_regex}) ]]; then
        echo "$commit" >&2
        echo "ERROR: Invalid commit message format" >&2
        echo "$commit_msg_header" >&2
        error="true"
      fi
    done
  done

if [ -n "$error" ]; then
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

- ⚠ make `.git/hooks/pre-receive` executable (unix: `chmod +x '.git/hooks/pre-receive'`)
