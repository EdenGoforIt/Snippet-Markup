System design considerations can vary based on the read and write ratios of your application. Below are some suggestions for each scenario:

1. High Read Ratio:
   a. Caching:
   Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently read data in-memory, reducing the load on the database.
   Consider using a distributed caching system like Redis or Memcached.
   b. Replication:
   Use read replicas to distribute read traffic across multiple database instances, improving read performance.
   Consider asynchronous replication for eventual consistency if real-time consistency is not a strict requirement.
   c. Indexing:
   Optimize database indexes for frequently queried fields to speed up read operations.
   Use composite indexes for queries involving multiple fields.
   d. Content Delivery Networks (CDN):
   Utilize CDNs to cache and serve static content close to the end-users, reducing the load on your servers.
   e. Sharding:
   Consider sharding the database to distribute the read load across multiple servers based on some criteria (e.g., user ID, geographic location).
2. High Write Ratio:
   a. Write Batch Processing:
   Group write operations into batches to reduce the number of individual write transactions.
   Use asynchronous processing for non-critical write operations.
   b. Replication and Sharding:
   Optimize database replication for write-heavy scenarios to ensure data consistency.
   Consider sharding the database to distribute write load across multiple servers.
   c. Caching:
   Invalidate or update cache on write operations to ensure consistency between the cache and the database.
   d. Asynchronous Queues:
   Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to handle write-heavy operations asynchronously.
3. Both Read and Write High:
   a. Load Balancing:
   Implement load balancing to distribute both read and write traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization.
   b. Hybrid Caching Strategies:
   Combine caching strategies for both read and write scenarios to achieve a balanced performance.
   Use write-through or write-behind caching strategies based on the requirements.
   c. Database Partitioning:
   Consider database partitioning to horizontally scale the database and distribute both read and write operations across multiple partitions.
   d. Use NoSQL Databases:
   Depending on your use case, consider NoSQL databases that can handle high read and write volumes with horizontal scaling.
   e. Content Delivery Networks (CDN):
   Utilize CDNs not only for static content but also for caching frequently accessed dynamic content close to the end-users.
