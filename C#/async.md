# Introduction

## Task

Three types of return type

- Task<TResult>, for an async method that returns a value.
- Task, for an async method that does not return a value.
- void, which we can use for an event handler.

- we should
use void only for the asynchronous event handlers which require
a void return type. Other than that, we should always return a Task.

- if our sync method returns no value (has a void for the return type),
then our async method should return Task. This means that we can use
the await keyword inside that method, but without the return keyword.

- Sometimes, the async code could
become slower than the sync one because EF Coreâ€™s async commands
take slightly longer to execute (due to extra code for handling the
threading), so leaving this option is always a good choice.

- It is general advice to use async code wherever it is possible, but if we
notice that our async code runes slower, we should switch back to the
sync one.
