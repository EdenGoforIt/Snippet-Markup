# Interface vs Abstract

- a mechanism for an abstraction and defining contracts for classes.
- Abstract class can be instantiate and used for a base class
- Abstract method must be overriden by the derived class
- Normal method can have implementation
- Interface can have only signatures members and the derived class must implement it

# Value vs Reference Type

- Reference Type variables are stored in the heap while Value Type variables are stored in the stack.
