> Motion of objects in the scene between an observer and the scene

# Terms

**Vector Field**

> A quantity with both magnitude and directino.

# Three method to overcome 4 fundamental problems

## block matching

Fidn some properties that can match blocks.

# Horn-Schunck

> Used to estimate hte motino of objects between two consecutive image frames with the assumptions that

1. Brighness is constant
2. Smoothness of the flow is constrained.

**Global**
Smooth, dense flow, slow motion

## Lucas-Kanade

**Local**
Assumes constant flow in a window
